# Elevator Control System
## Using Digital Electronic Components only


### Introduction

A simulation study of elevator control of a 3-storey building has been presented in this project. I 
have focused on logic formulation of the probable events associated with movement of the elevator and 
implemented the logic equations using standard digital circuit simulator software Proteus 7 Professional. 

Major sections of the entire circuit structure are input unit, directional control unit, priority encoder, level positioning 
control unit, output display unit and clock controlling unit. Simulated results from the circuit simulator software 
show exact match with the desired results which proves our design validity.
